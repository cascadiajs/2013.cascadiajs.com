##Abstract

Web workers are an exciting technology that allows web developers to fully harness modern multi processors. So why haven't you seen them in any of your favorite libraries? I will explore techniques for using workers cross-domain in libraries, problems that workers solve well, and problems that you’d think workers would solve but don’t through copious pictures of cats.

![Calvin Metcalf](https://raw.github.com/cascadiajs/2013.cascadiajs.com/master/images/calvinmetcalf.png)

I'm a cartographer by day and civic hacker by night.  Among the projects I’ve worked on I have [a web worker library](http://catilinejs.com/) where much of my experience for the talk comes from, I’ve also worked on [parsing binary files in the browser](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/shapefile-js) and [census visualizations](http://census.calvinmetcalf.com/). A few other talks I’ve given include [Leaflet for cats](http://www.scribd.com/doc/132405519/leaflet-for-some-cats-with-apologies-to-Max-Ogden) and [one on exporting data to GeoJSON](http://calvinmetcalf.github.io/esri2open).
