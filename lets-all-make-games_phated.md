##Abstract

Game creation has traditionally been scary, for various reasons (low-level languages, poor tooling, memory management).

Luckily, we now have the technology (WebGL, canvas, WebAudio) to build games where we are comfortable - the browser.

I will investigate the ways we can apply our expertise in web development to build games and make things a little less scary.

I am half of Iced Dev, an HTML5 games company and JavaScript consultancy. We have created [FrozenJS](http://frozenjs.com), an open-source game engine focused on providing tools for web developers to easily create games.  You can always find me coding, but recently I started
controlling hardware with JS - like controlling a drone with Google Glass, Node and a WebSocket.
