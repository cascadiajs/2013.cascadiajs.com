##Abstract

Learning git is like learning to read: once you understand, it's hard to remember what it was like not to. This makes it very hard for experienced git users to teach beginners, and unfortunately, the official git documentation doesn't much help. Learning git can help beginners feel more comfortable with the command line, GitHub, and contributing to projects, thus empowering them to learn more by seeking out example code and building an early excitement for open source.

This talk will outline the major difficulties for beginners learning git, point out some of the shortfalls of the existing documentation and resources, and suggest some ways the CascadiaJS community can help teach and encourage beginners through tutorials, documentation, and one-on-one mentorship.
