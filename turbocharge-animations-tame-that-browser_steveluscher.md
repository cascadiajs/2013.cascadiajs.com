##Abstract

In this talk you will learn how to design turbocharged procedural animation code. You will acquire a set of strategies to conserve the browser's rendering muscle, eliminating inessential rendering activity, so that it can concentrate on animating your widgets at ludicrous speed.

Stylesheets and high-level API for manipulating the appearance of DOM elements on screen make it easy to ignore the demands that your application imposes on the browser's rendering engine. Come along for a peek into the world of document reflows and repaints; you may be surprised how small tweaks to your code can turn a laggy mess into a buttery-smooth animation.

I build web and mobile applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and Objective-C. En-route to becoming a programmer, I made stops at graphic design school and my local university's math department; experiences which have served me well in the area of client-side application development.

I work with a bunch of nerds building [Leanpub][], most certainly the best way to write, publish, and sell an in-progress ebook.
