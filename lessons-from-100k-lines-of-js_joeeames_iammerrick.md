##Abstract

This talk will examine the lessons learned while building a very large single page application (SPA). The application discussed has one hundred thousand lines of client-side JavaScript code, and was built on AMD and Backbone.JS against a RESTful HTTP back end. An examination of the technical wins and losses, good ideas, bad ideas, and everything in between. We will cover code structure and organization, 3rd party development tools used, custom development tools built, automated and manual testing, development practices and methodologies used, organizational structure, stategies for performance and maintainability, and how each of these items affected the cost of the project. The focus will be on disseminating wisdom for future projects of this size and bigger.
