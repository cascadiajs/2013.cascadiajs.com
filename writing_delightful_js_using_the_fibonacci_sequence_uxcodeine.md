##Abstract

Learn how to control the User Interface by injecting the Fibonacci sequence in your code.  Use the Fibonacci sequence in JS functions, animations, callbacks and lists to write code that is strategic, manageable, and enhances the user experience. See how to use JS and CSS harmoniously with the Fibonacci sequence to overwrite the css box model (margins, paddings, dimensions etc), grid systems (using 5-13 cols), animation (pacing, intervals) and creating organic pattern libraries that are never completed (style guides).
