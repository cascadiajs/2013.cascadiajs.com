##Abstract

Just a short time ago rendering a PDF would have only been considered a task that a native application could handle. However, with the advent of many new HTML5 APIs and blazing fast JavaScript engines it is now possible to create native like applications within the browser. In this talk I’ll cover Mozilla’s reasons for creating PDF.js, a brief overview of the PDF format, how we parse and render PDF’s using JavaScript and HTML5, and some of the lessons we learned along the way.
