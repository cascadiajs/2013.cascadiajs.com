##Abstract

When you're writing code to demo browser performance analysis tools, how do you write code that's bad enough to show off the tools, but good enough not to insult an audience of professional developers? We faced that problem when writing docs that demonstrated the new performance analysis features in IE11's F12 Developer Tools. I'll discuss some of the performance anti-patterns we tried to demonstrate and the challenges of writing bad code a good coder might actually write.
