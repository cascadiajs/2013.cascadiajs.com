# NLP vs Twitter: A Voyage into Linguistic Frontiers

## Description

Given a linguistic frontier like Twitter, we are tempted to dive down the rabbit hole of semantic analysis, but for online communities whose evolution outpaces the traditional development of corpuses, we need a to look at every tool we have to uncover their secrets.

We'll demonstrate how to answer questions like "How do idioms grow and spread?", "What regions are evolving fastest linguistically?", and "What regions' tendencies are spreading, or shrinking?" using a Node.js app to collect data from Twitter, MapReduce jobs to slice and dice it upon retrieval, and d3.js to generate share-able graphs of your research.

We'll focus on analyzing n-grams using CouchDB, but we'll discuss many techniques both statistical and semantic for studying language, teaching machines to parse it, and what JavaScript libraries will help you do that.

## Bio

![Me :D](https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1554764061/catlin_bigger.jpg)

In Portland, Oregon born and raised

On the web was where I spent most of my days

Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool

and making crappy websites outside of the school

When a couple of guys, who were up to no good

Started coding node in my neighborhood

I wrote one little app and I got scared

and said, "callbacks are crazy but this has some flair!"
