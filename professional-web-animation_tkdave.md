##Abstract

This talk is not about WebGL, canvas drawing, or sprite sheets. It's about real, hard-working, everyday, hardware-accelerated animation with JavaScript, CSS Transforms (and sometimes canvas). 

We will mention CSS Animation in passing as we introduce the [Greensock Animation Platform](http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/) as our foundation for quality procedural animation. We'll discuss ways to hack the  transform matrix and point out some cross-platform pitfalls. Repaints, framerates, and optimization are all on the agenda as we discuss generative animation, easing, oscillation and curves.
