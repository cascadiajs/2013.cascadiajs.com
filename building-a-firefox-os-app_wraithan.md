##Abstract

Firefox OS is a new mobile operating system from Mozilla. Apps are all written
in HTML5 (HTML, CSS, JS) instead of the traditional compiled languages that have
 been used on mobile devices.

This talk will walk you through the app develoment process. From creating your
app manifest, to testing your app in the simulator, to pushing your app to
device. It will not cover details like submission to the marketplace or inapp
payments.
