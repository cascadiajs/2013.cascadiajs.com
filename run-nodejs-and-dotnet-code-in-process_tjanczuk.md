## Abstract

The choice between Node.js and .NET for your application is a compromise. While everything *can* be done in either Node.js or .NET, specific things are usually *better* done in one of them. This talk will explore [Edge.js][]: a mechanism to run Node.js and .NET code in-process and enable you to use the best technology for the task at hand.

I am helping to develop and ship software for Microsoft. My current focus and passion is Node.js and Windows Azure. Before that I worked on .NET Framework and web services. Some of my OSS work includes [iisnode][] (host Node.js applications in IIS on Windows and Windows Azure), [Edge.js][] (interop between Node.js and .NET in-process), and [httpsys][] (HTTP.SYS stack for Node.js on Windows). In my free time I engage in a lot of outdoor activities in the Pacific Northwest and beyond.
