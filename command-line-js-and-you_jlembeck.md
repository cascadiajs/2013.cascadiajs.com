##Abstract

People use JS for all sorts of Browser and Robot fun stuff, but what
about those of us who like being in the trenches of the command line?
Ever install a binary using NPM so somebody doesn't have to do it
globally? Ever automate a task with Grunt? Ever write a phantomjs script
that has NOTHING to do with tests? Let's roll up our sleeves and get our
nerd on.
