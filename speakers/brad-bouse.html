<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Forget those lucrative contracting jobs and make something useless! Between Node.js, WebGL, and the ever-faster evolution of JS engines, Javascript is an ideal platform to make interactive and/or generative art.</p>
<p>This talk will have three parts:</p>
<p>A) A survey of the tools for creating art with JavaScript (graphics, tweening, 3D) and how to connect to input devices (webcam, Kinect, LeapMotion, Arduino) to make amazing things.</p>
<p>B) A demo and walkthrough of a Leap/JavaScript app I wrote. Users form and destroy particle-based words with their fingertips. I&#39;ll explain how to get started with Leap + JS, describe the app&#39;s architecture (receiving position information from the Leap SDK via node, updating the application state, and optimizing performance), and cover some common (and unexpected) problems. This Leap project is a gallery installation that is a followup to Between Page and Screen, a digital popup book of poetry (more on that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s-JFxEmtpY">here</a> and <a href="http://betweenpageandscreen.com">here</a>).</p>
<p>C) Practical takeways from creative code: become a better engineer by stretching the boundaries.
- Performance. When you&#39;re trying to maintain &gt;30FPS you need to be zealous about writing tight, efficient code.
- Memory Leaks. Installed pieces can run for days without a refresh. With single-page apps, users can sit on a single screen for hours. How does your app manage memory use and garbage collection?
- Event-based interaction. The Leap spits out events at &gt;90FPS--that&#39;s far messier than simply handling user clicks. How do you coordinate your app&#39;s internal events with this firehose of user input?
- Learn far more about CSS-vs-SVG-vs-Canvas performance than you ever wanted to know.
- Dive into the bizarro world of GPUs! It makes IE look downright sensible.</p>
<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>
<p><img src="/images/speakers/brad-bouse.png" alt="doolittle"></p>
<p>I went to film school and somehow ended up doing startups. As a very early employee, I designed and coded the family tree interface for <a href="http://geni.com">Geni</a> and the desktop app for <a href="http://yammer.com">Yammer</a>. With the poet Amaranth Borsuk, I wrote the software for <a href="http://betweenpageandscreen.com">Between Page and Screen</a>, a digital popup book of poetry that has written up in Wired, Salon, The Economist, and even American Scientist. Now I help early-stage startups figure out how to design and build the first version of their product. On the side, I build weird things.</p>
