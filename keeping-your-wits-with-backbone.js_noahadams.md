## Abstract
A year ago, Mobify embarked to build a rich front-end app for creating mobile web sites from your existing website, called Mobify Studio.

We found Backbone.js to be an invaluable foundation for our application, but along the way, we learned about, used and developed a great number of tools and techniques to preserve our sanity while developing a many-thousand line application for the browser.

In this presentation I'll talk about the patterns we use:

* module systems
* using as little or as much as you like
* code re-use by any means necessary
* sub-views, inheritance and delegates
* compiled templates
* build systems
