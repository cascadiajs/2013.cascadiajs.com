## Abstract

[Terraformer](https://github.com/Esri/Terraformer) is a geo-toolkit that helps you build large-scale geographic applications and databases.

[Terraformer](https://github.com/Esri/Terraformer) helps you navigate the various geo-formats, acts as a geometry and primitives engine, and helps you build powerful geo-databases.  Stop thinking locally, and start thinking globally as you learn how to build your own databases with multiple backends (memory, localstorage, leveldb, postgresql, etc) and multiple index types in node.js and the browser.

This talk will cover the basics of Geometry, Terraformer, and building your own bespoke geo-databases.
