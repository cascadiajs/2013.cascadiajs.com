## Abstract

Finding an open source library based on features, popularity, and code quality is a daunting task in the face of tens of thousands of modules. Navigating the Bazaar is about forming authenticate connections with the programmers who write the code libraries that we use every day, and look to those connections when we are looking for new libraries. I propose we recognize that we are already in interdependent and mutually valuable relationships with these developers, and that we honor those connections, because it's part of making what we do and who we are into a single, holistic experience.

## Speaker bio

Version2beta's first professional gig was almost 3 decades ago, cost the company $30, and saved them $3 million in the first year. Once he learned how to get paid for his work, he designed the control system for the electric car that won the 1992 Solar and Electric Vehicle Association race, which the Associated Press reported as the first use of real-time race telemetry. Later projects included a dual-headed robot laser welder. Then the Internet got big and Version2beta shifted gears into cyberspace. He currently works as a developer at iTV in Provo, UT, where he helps create platforms for cultural discourse about broadcast media.

Outside of programming and devops, Version2beta is a cultural dissident, part-time communitarian, homesteader, and wannabe anarchoprimitivist.
