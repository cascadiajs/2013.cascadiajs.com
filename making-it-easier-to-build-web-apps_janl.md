##Abstract

When building anything, one needs to keep a few things in mind to ensure 
success. Two primary ones are:

1. The target audience.
2. Real-world constraints.

The current state of web development ignores these two at everyoneâ€™s peril.

This talk invites you to rethink modern web development a little bit, just 
enough to build a better technical foundation for everyone to use.

We will be looking at freeing frond-end developers from their shackles of 
backend technology and the offline-first approach to build better, more 
enjoyable, more functional and more mobile-friendly user experiences.
