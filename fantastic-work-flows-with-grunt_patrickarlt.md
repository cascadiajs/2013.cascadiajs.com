## Abstract

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is a task runner for JavaScript that helps automate mundane tasks.

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is a fantastic tool for focusing your development workflows. At Esri we use Grunt in several of our JavaScript (and non JavaScript) projects to build lint, preprocess, build, test and minify projects.

This talk will cover how to setup Grunt, install plugins and show some example grunt tasks as well as how to write your own custom tasks.
