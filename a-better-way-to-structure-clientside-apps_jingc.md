## Abstract

Over the years, engineers at Facebook have developed opinions about how best to structure client-side JavaScript applications. We've come to believe that bidirectional data binding is difficult, and mutating data models directly doesn't scale well over time. In the past year or so, we've abandoned the traditional MVC approach in favor of a single directional data flow architecture we call Flux.

Coupled with a rendering framework like [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html), this approach to building client-side applications lends itself well to testability and maintainability, allowing engineers to move fast and face fewer bugs. This talk will give an overview of this architecture, and try to shed some light on why this approach has worked so well for us.
