##Abstract

Robotics has been a hot topic for the past year, especially with JavaScript and Node.js.  With such libraries as node-serialport and Johnny-Five, JavaScript has become a premiere language for pushing robotics to the everyday developer.  Windows 8.1 has also followed the trend of making hardware more accessible through new APIs to such things as USB, Bluetooth and even native 3D Printer support.  Now, using nothing but the power of JavaScript and WinRT, you can develop the next generation hardware.  In this presentation, we will cover the basics of what’s supported in Windows 8.1, and what’s the art of the possible with just some simple hardware, an Xbox controller and your imagination!
