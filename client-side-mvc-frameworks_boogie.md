##Abstract

To provide an industry leading support experience for our users, I as the lead engineer at
[Prezi Support](https://prezi.com/support/) always try to find great solutions to help our agents. Recently,
we created a web-based CRM system to make agents more productive. Using a client side MVC was a no-brainer
(we replaced a generated admin solution). Now we can engineer high-speed, non-traditional, and easy-to-use user
interfaces. We selected a framework that was best for our goals and implemented our key features with the most
popular variations. I will share these implementations and introduce the strengths and weaknesses of
[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).
As we ended up selecting AngularJS, (it’s feature-rich, standard-friendly, easy to test and extend, as well
as being popular), I will go a lot deeper into its details. It emerged as the best solution for us and maybe
it’s the most future proof decision for everyone.
