## Abstract

As JavaScript developers, we've always been taught to program within the JavaScript environment given to us by the web browser. However, the browser doesn't always give us the environment we wish we had, biting us with poor performance and inflexibility.

In the name of speed and profit, how can we extend the web ourselves? How can we change when it executes JavaScript, fires events, or downloads images?

The nature of JavaScript allows it to be dynamic, and we can utilize this power, along with some tomfoolery, to force the browser to render faster.

Let's hack the browser!
