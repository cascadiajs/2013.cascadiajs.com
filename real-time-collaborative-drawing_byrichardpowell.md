##Abstract

We can do more in JavaScript than we ever could before and quicker too.  In this presentation I'm going to create a real-time collaborative drawing tool using JavaScript technologies.  I'll be live coding, so hold on to your hats.  But think about that: I'm confident I can create a real-time collaborative drawing tool in the time it takes to give a presentation.  JavaScript has come so far.
