## Abstract

Not enough opportunities to hang out with local JS folks? Start your own user group.

There are a few tips, tricks, leadership, and organizational skills that will help you organize, and participate in your local meet (or drink) up. Most importantly as an organize you will want make sure to create a consistent, high quality event that folks feel pumped to be a part of. But how do you do that? How do you find a venue, speakers, sponsors? How to you keep recruiters away? How do you let people know about your event?

There are a bunch of variables but they can be easily managed. I'll share how we run the [JS.LA][jsla] group and a few of the things we have learned along the way.

You don't need permission to start a group, you just need to make it happen ;)

I'm an organizer of [JS.LA][jsla] and software developer with a disturbing love for JS. I spent some time doing punk/ DIY shows before my software career which provides a unique set of experiences for organizing our tech events in LA.
