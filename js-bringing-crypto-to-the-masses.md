##Abstract

Privacy is an increasing concern among people both developers and users. We are constantly seeing it stripped from us be it from companies are government. But we have a great ability to combat this problem. In this talk I want to give everyone the ability to start understanding cryptography and choosing if they want to become an expert in it. Highlights:

 * What the hell consistutes cryptography.
 * The difference between rot13, xor and some true cryptographiacally safe algorithms
 * What Javascript can bring and do for crypto.
 * The problematics of clientside crypto.

Historical fact: Cryptography is 4000 years old. Why are we so afraid of it?
