## Abstract
Building modern web applications, particularly javascript driven single page applications can quickly devolve in a mess of callbacks and spaghetti code. One way out of this madness to require each part of the application to communicate with nothing more than events. Backbone applications, while allowing this behaviour, do not exactly encourage it and building such applications is sometimes harder than it should be. 

Twitter Flight, on the other hand, is a new minimal framework that allows nothing else. Each part of the application is entirely driven by events, either emitting or receiving them and has no other connection to any part of the application. 

Enforcing such a drastic architecture creates a cleaner, modular  application and lessons learned from Twitter's approach can easily be applied to other front-end frameworks.
