##Abstract

Front-end developers, fear not -- back-ends are overrated. You can build a real-time single-page app without touching Node.js or sockets. Single-page Apps were rendered useless without a back-end serving, persisting and propagating the data. Not anymore. Firebase can serve as your backend, and as a bonus, it keeps your clients up-to-date real-time.

One of Angular's most-touted features is two-way data binding -- with [AngularFire](https://www.firebase.com/blog/2013-03-29-firebase-bindings-for-angular.html) you now have *x-way* data binding across clients!

This talk will explain why Angular and Firebase is a match made in heaven and should be added to your tool-box -- especially if you're a front-end developer. As a case in point, we'll walk through the making of [T3 - Multiplayer Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://mck-.github.io/T3), and zoom in on a few challenges and caveats. Hopefully this talk will expand your realm of possibilities with front-end alone.
