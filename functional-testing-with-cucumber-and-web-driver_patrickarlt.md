## Abstract

Unit testing is all well and good. But at the end of the day you need to know that what users will be seeing and interacting with works and your application works from a business and design standpoint.

This is where functional testing can help. This talk will show how to test web applications using [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) and [wd.js](https://github.com/admc/wd). This kind of testing tests the entire application as a whole as opposed to confirming the detailed functionality of a single component.
