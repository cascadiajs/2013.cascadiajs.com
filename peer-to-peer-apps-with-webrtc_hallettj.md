## Abstract

WebRTC is a new browser API designed for peer-to-peer video
conferencing.  But it is useful for more than just video.  It is
possible for the first time to build peer-to-peer web applications.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) has been used to achieve performance and data
availability (BitTorrent), to provide privacy (Tor), and to disrupt
long-held assumptions (Bitcoin).  A recurring theme of P2P is that it
empowers users.

Web apps are inherently accessible - an app can be loaded and run just
by clicking a link.  The combination of P2P and web has potential for
disruptive apps with low barriers to entry.

I will describe building a distributed hash table (DHT) that operates in
the browser, with an introduction to a reusable library that provides
this functionality.  I will talk about building apps on top of a DHT.
And I will discuss issues of reliability, performance, and
interoperability of WebRTC data channels.
