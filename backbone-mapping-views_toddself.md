##Abstract

The pain of building an interactive map has been greatly reduced thanks to tools like Google Maps, Leaflet.js, MapBox and OpenStreetMaps, but there's still one beguiling part &#151; creating custom overlay views to replace the stock standard pin and box widgets provided by the mapping tools themselves. This talk shows how you can create a base Backbone view which incorporates the various prototypes provided by the mapping APIs to provide automatic placement and pixel-offsetting of your view so that when the map scrolls or zooms, it stays where it's supposed to! I will also discuss methods and patterns for handling child views inside of your main view container, and providing for communication between the child views and the parent view which will allow us to create more complex sections directly on top of the map view.
