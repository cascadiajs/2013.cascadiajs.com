## Abstract

Asm.js is a technology to unlock high performance in today's JavaScript
engines, but it's only meant as a compilation target for C/C++
applications and is not easily accessible to JavaScript developers.

Low-Level JavaScript (LLJS) is an experimental language from Mozilla
that mixes C-like language constructs with JavaScript. In this talk I
will explain how I ported LLJS to run on asm.js, allowing web
developers to tap into the huge performance gains with asm.js. Using
LLJS, you can integrate low-level code that runs on asm.js with
JavaScript apps easily. I will explore a high-performance WebGL app that
uses this.

LLJS is in its infancy, and I will also discuss our plans for the future.

I work for Mozilla. I created and maintain several node projects like
Nunjucks, which is a templating system used by several big sites like
the Mozilla Marketplace. I love games and hacking around with
canvas/WebGL, and low-level gritty coding.
