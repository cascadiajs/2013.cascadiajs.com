##Abstract

Google been pushing the [Mirror API](https://developers.google.com/glass/about) as the main way to communicate with Glass and only recently they released the [GDK](https://developers.google.com/glass/gdk) (Android) for Glass. The main question remain open; what [can be done](http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/10/google-glass-app-funding/) with it?

In this talk we will go over the process and new challenges of developing a fully functional Glass app implemented on the Mirror API via Node.js, and new tools we've built along the way.

We will share our learnings on how a Glass apps differ from a web app, how to manage user life-cycle in Glass from the moment the user auth to the app to to message them and listen for updates, while keeping in mind the UX guidelines.

We hope to show up to 3 demos, building interactive stories with glass (mirror), image eating monster (mirror), and real-time information consumption (GDK+sockets).
