## Abstract

Nodebots, nodecopters, nodeboats: how does the node- get glued to the -bot? How do you use javascript to make a robot roll forward, a quadcopter take off, or a rubber band sproing into the air? Why is Javascript so good for this? Isn't this the domain of Serious C Programmers writing Serious C? 

Where does the Javascript run, anyway?

After the next half hour, you'll know exactly where the JS runs and how. You'll know the difference between an Arduino and a Raspberry PI, a GND pin and a PWM pin, 5V and 9V, serial and USB, JohnnyFive and Firmata. You'll know why JS's event-loop makes it perfect for interacting with hardware. Most importantly, you'll have everything you need to help bring about the Javascript robot apocalypse.

Ceej wrote her first computer program in pen in a spiral bound notebook because the Apple ][+ hadn't arrived yet. It was a D&D character generator in BASIC. Currently she writes javascript in node.js for a stealth startup while hacking on javascript quadcopter drivers for fun.
