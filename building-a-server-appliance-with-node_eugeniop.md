##Abstract
Auth0 is a server/service to drastically simplify authentication, identity federation & SSO scenarios; for web & mobile apps. It's our first big project on node. One of the reasons we decided to build it entirely on node, is the ability to package it and deploy it anywhere: as a service in the public cloud, as a virtual appliance on private cloud, or as an appliance on-premises. In this session we'll show how we built it. How we use for extensibility and easy customization. What worked well, what didn't. Tools we used, etc.
