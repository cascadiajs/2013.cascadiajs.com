##Abstract

The web has struggled with abstraction since its inception. Enter oj.js, a library that simplifies website design into smart, view objects. Objects that render themselves and then can be used to dynamically change their contents after the fact.

Together we will explore how object encapsulation will reinvent the web, why few people know about JavaScript properties, that two-way model binding is the shiznet, and how to change the world -- one plugin at a time.
