##Abstract

The cat's out of the bag: you can program robots with JavaScript! (If you didn't know that yet - now you do!) You've got your Arduino, and johnny-five has got your LED blinking like a champ! Now how do we get it to make you breakfast already? 

Let's level-up on your robot skills. Building a robot is just like building the next great app - to prove it, we'll talk about how to build BatBot, which uses sonar to navigate around the world... all by itself!
