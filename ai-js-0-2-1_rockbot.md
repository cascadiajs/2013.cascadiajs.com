##Abstract

The cat's out of the bag: you can program robots with JavaScript! (If you didn't know that yet - now you do!) And hey, the little robot you built at International NodeBots Day is not only AWESOME, it's also super adorable - congratulations!

So, your little bot has got some great moves, but it's not making you breakfast yet?

Let's level-up on your robot skills. We'll talk about kinematics (so you can make your robot move like a pro) and object recognition via computer vision (so your robot knows if it's going high or low), and then we'll try to give a robot a high-five (unless you're too slow!).
