#How To Submit A Proposal

*First, make sure you're available to attend the conference. It will be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada on November 14-15.*

* Create a [Github account][] if you don't have one already
* Fork this repository
* Checkout the `master` branch
* Create and commit a markdown (.md) file in this directory named after the talk title and your Github ID.

For example, if your talk is called "Intro To Node.js" and your Github ID is `janedoe`, name the file `intro-to-nodejs_janedoe.md`. Check out this [example template][] if you need help.

* Commit an image of yourself in the images subdirectory, named after your Github id. Format should be PNG, 256x256 Eg: `images/janedoe.png`
* When you're ready, submit a pull request.
* Send an email to [info@cascadiajs.com][] to introduce yourself and so that we have a way to contact you if your talk is accepted.
* Wait patiently (and nicely) for us to get back to you. We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal even if it's just to say "Thanks but no thanks".

##What should be in the proposal?

Every proposal should have, at minimum, the following information: 

* Your Full Name
* Presentation Title
* Presentation Description
* Your preferred photo for the website (256x256)

If would be great if you could add in a short personal bio (50 words or less) and other details like links to your **blog**, **twitter account**, **open source projects**, **company**, or what have you, that's completely up to you. Whatever floats your boat. Bios are nice! :)

To make this easier, we've created a template you can copy and modify. See `proposal-template_jane-doe.md` in this directory.

If you have any other artifacts that relate to your presentation, like slide decks, code samples, videos, etc, make a directory named the same as the .MD file from above, and put related files in there. For example, if my proposal was saved in `intro-to-nodejs_janedoe.md`, I would place the example code in `/intro-to-nodejs_janedoe/example-code.js` 


##What are we looking for?

We're looking for anything related to the open web, which includes: browser, Node.js, Windows 8, Firefox OS, tooling, robots, you name it. Please, no vendor pitches (i.e. How to Use Product X). A great talk should address issues that developers struggle with, break down and explain complicated topics and cover new ground in JS technology. 

All the talks will be 30 minutes.

We're also open to suggestions for unconference topics. For example, suppose you really want to talk about MongoDB in Node.js but don't have a presentation, maybe just some questions or experiences to share? We will likely set aside time for lightning talks, so get your ideas ready.

##Other Stuff

The deadline to submit a proposal is **August 15, 2013**. You are free to submit (and even revise) proposals up until that date. Please

If you have any questions about this process, need more information or need assistance with travel and/or lodging, don't hesitate to reach out to us at [info@cascadiajs.com][].
