# Living on the Edge: CouchDB, PouchDB, and Offline Sync

## Description

One of the coolest things about CouchDB is master-master replication. PouchDB makes this even cooler by allowing you to replicate right into the client, so that even if the user loses connectivity, they can continue to operate, and sync when they come back online. I'll show you just how easy CouchDB and PouchDB make creating web apps with this functionality.

## Bio

![Me :D](https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1554764061/catlin_bigger.jpg)

In Portland, Oregon born and raised

On the web was where I spent most of my days

Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool

and making crappy websites outside of the school

When a couple of guys, who were up to no good

Started coding node in my neighborhood

I wrote one little app and I got scared

and said, "callbacks are crazy but this has some flair!"

Max Thayer is a Fun Captain at Cloudant who dreams in JavaScript and only minds callbacks sometimes.
