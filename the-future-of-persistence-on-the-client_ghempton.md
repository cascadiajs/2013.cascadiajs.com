## Abstract

In a world that is quickly moving to the client, the way applications save data is lagging sorely behind. Frameworks such as Ember.js and Angular have recently emerged, providing rich abstractions around how applications are structured and presented, but the way changes are persisted to the backend is essentially the same as it was a decade ago.

In this talk, we explore how most client-side applications interface with their persistence layer and why naive AJAX is not enough. Alternative streaming solutions are discussed as well as how REST can be improved for long-running client-side applications.

AdminJS, a soon to be released open source framework, will also be introduced. AdminJS is a backend-agnostic client-side adminstration framework that takes advantage of some of the techniques discussed in the talk.
