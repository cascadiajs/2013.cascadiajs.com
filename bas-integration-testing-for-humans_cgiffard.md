## Abstract

[Behaviour Assertion Sheets](http://bas.cgiffard.com), or BAS, is a new, open 
source testing language/framework written in node and utilising a declarative,
CSS-inspired syntax for friendly client-side integration testing.

Conventional integration testing can be frustrating. There are lots of tools
available â€” many of which are exceptionally powerful. But most of us have also
struggled with complicated systems that suck up hours of time, and require us
to write highly dependent tests in bulky arcane syntax. (*cough* selenium *cough*)

Testing should be repeatable and produce reusable tests. Testing should be easy,
and writing good tests should be possible for inexperienced programmers and even
non-developers.

BAS is an attempt to solve this problem using a familiar, simple declarative
syntax. BAS makes it simple to write versatile tests which can be easily reused.
Because of this flexibility, BAS can also be used as a QA and reporting tool,
capable of scanning websites for broken links, behaviour, or even accessibility
or content readability issues.

In this talk I'll describe the motivations behind BAS, the problems it solves and
the things it can't yet do. Hopefully you'll all be inspired to think about
testing in new ways.

Christopher is a somewhat unconventional federal government employee from
Canberra, Australia. Reluctantly known for his work in video accessibility and
delivery, (embarrassingly enough, [people have even written books featuring it!](http://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Media-Shelley-Powers/dp/1449304451))
he's always looking for new ways to horribly break JavaScript in pursuit of some
new and elusive invention. Christopher is a core contributor to the
[Ghost blogging platform](http://tryghost.org/) and co-organises the Canberra JS
user group.

Not unlike every second software developer in the known universe,
[he composes electronic music](http://soundcloud.com/cgiffard),
[is an amateur photographer](http://flickr.com/christophergiffard), and studies
Japanese.
