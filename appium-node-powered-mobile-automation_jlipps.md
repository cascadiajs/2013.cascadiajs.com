##Abstract

Appium is a Node.js server that makes automating native and hybrid mobile
applications easy, using any programming language. When we started work on
Appium, which has become a successful open-source project with the better part
of a thousand resolved GitHub issues and pull requests, we had our choice of
programming languages and frameworks. For a variety of reasons, we chose
Node.js to power this automation server, intended to be used not excluseively
by Node devs but by all kinds of devs and QA engineers.

This talk is a reflection on the upshot of having chosen Node, from technical,
architectural, and cultural points of view. It will contain an introduction to
Appium itself, and a tour of the choices we made along the way, some good and
some bad, which will be of interest to anyone looking to start a sizeable
Node-based open-source project, especially if they want non-Node devs to be
involved.
