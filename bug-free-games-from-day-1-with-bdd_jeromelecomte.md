##Abstract

Behavior-Driven Development is a methodology enabling you to develop better, more reliable applications faster through test cases. Seldom used in the game industry, it would yield huge benefits for indie-game developers as well as established game companies. Whether you want to learn the basics or you're having difficulty getting started with Behavior-Driven Development, this talk will illustrate the advantages of this methodology by walking you through a practical example: the building of a web-based version of Simon through the use of test cases.

The presenation will introduce Mocha and Sinon.js to the audience and cover the following topics:
* Benefits of BDD
* Applying BDD to video game development
* Testing your game logic
* Testing your game UI

The [source code](https://github.com/jerle76/simon-game) for Simon, the [playable game](http://jerle76.github.io/simon-game) and its [test suite](http://jerle76.github.io/simon-game/tests.html) are available on my github account.

I'm a Torontonian web developer at [OANDA](http://fxtrade.oanda.com) where I design a Forex trading application that gracefully adapts to all kind of screen sizes and devices. I live and breath Javascript. I'm a convert to the "test first, come up with code later" persuasion. In a previous life I also build 2 massively multiplayer online games for the West European market.

I enjoy retro videogaming (pixels are beautiful), building LEGO with my 2 sons (bricks are beautiful) and single malt Scotch (alcohol is bea^D^D^D... oups).
