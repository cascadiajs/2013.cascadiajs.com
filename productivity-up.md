##Abstract

The major ingredient that makes working with JavaScript so much fun is the high level of productivity it enables due to its
dynamic nature. Unfortunately many of us have gotten used to one way of doing things without questioning if we could be more
productive if we optimized it.

This presentation is designed to get the attendees excited about re-evaluating their workflow and tools in order to
push their productivity level to the absolute maximum.

The live demonstration which constitutes the bigger part of the presentation will show how to meet the following
requirements in order to be productive:

- minimize turn around time for writing a line of code to seeing results
  - server side: run your code or pipe it into a repl via editor shortcut
  - client side: refresh the browser with updated code via editor shortcut
- interact with your own and third party code in order to quickly assess if/how it works
- access documentation like Readmes for libraries and jsdocs/comments for functions within a second right from the
  console
- quickly find, inspect and/or edit functions of third party libraries to learn how they work, i.e. by injecting log statements

The focus of the demonstration is not on certain tools, but on showing how to use and tweak them to become part of a
highly productive workflow. I do however hope to make the attendees aware of benefits that can be gained by giving
[browserify][], the node repl or [replpad][] and editor plugins like [syntastic][] or equivalents a go.

![thlorenz](https://raw.github.com/cascadiajs/2013.cascadiajs.com/master/images/thlorenz.png)

I have been working with nodejs and JavaScript for over 2 years mostly in my spare time and lately full time at [Condé Nast][].

The fast turnaround from idea to working module has proven addictive for me and led to lots of modules which ended up on
github and/or npm. I also contribute to other awesome open source efforts like [browserify][] to which I added source
map support.
