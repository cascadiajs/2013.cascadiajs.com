## Abstract

Object capabilities are a discipline that encourages POLA (Principle Of Least Authority). Sticking to this discipline
which is an extreme form of object orientation, code naturally has less bugs by design and is easier to maintain.
It most often leads to better performance and more importantly better user experience.
And it's just a discipline. No need for a framework or a library beyond [vapor.js](http://vaporjs.com/).

In this talk, I'll explain the magics behind this discipline through concrete examples.
