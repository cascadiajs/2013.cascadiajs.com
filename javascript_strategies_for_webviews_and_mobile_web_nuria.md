##Abstract

In 2011 and 2012 we saw our traffic rapidly migrating to mobile. In 2013, of the 5 million 
unique users we get in a week, about 50% use mobile; of those, 2 million users use mobile only. 
Being mostly a web-based company, we had to find ways to meet the challenge of adapting 
our product to mobile and being able to develop fast enough in that environment.

In this talk I will share the ways in which we have solved issues that we struggled 
with when developing Webviews and Mobile Web. Why hybrid apps (native/HTML) and Mobile Web 
are two closely related, but significantly different problems. I will go into why the most important thing 
when you develop for mobile is to know your user base. Why user agent sniffing is helpful when determining 
levels of support. How having a flavor of a mobile website that works everywhere allows us to support legacy 
browsers forever, for free. I will also discuss PhoneGap and how it can be a game changer, but also how 
the best way to use it in a hybrid app might not be the obvious one.

##Speaker Bio

![nuria](images/nuria.png)
 have been working on the web for over ten years. The bulk of my experience comes from the 7 years 
 I worked at Amazon.com in various positions. I had to learn a lot there because before taking that job 
 I made my living doing research in Oceanography. On 2010 I joined tuenti.com, a social network in Spain where 
 I discover mobile and I thought, hey, is just like the desktop ten years ago.
