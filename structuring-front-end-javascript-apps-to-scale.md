## Abstract

Over the past year or so, the company I've *just joined* have been building a developer toolkit and lightweight front-end framework that's helped them ensure that a 200k LoC JavaScript SDK hasn't become a tangled mess of unstable spaghetti code. This SDK is then delivered to enterprise organisations who are expected to build on top of around 50k LoC example functionality that's shipped with the SDKâ€¦ and not turn that into a tangled mess of unstable spaghetti code. At the same time, all this code needs to be easy to navigate, maintain, continually test, enhance and develop upon.

How is this achieved with an app of this scale, you may ask?

In this talk I won't directly discuss the toolkit itself, but instead cover the main points that have been considered when trying to achieve what might sound like the impossible.
