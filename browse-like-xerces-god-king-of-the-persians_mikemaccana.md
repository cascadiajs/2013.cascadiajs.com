##Abstract

Many of the web apps we use every day are not worthy of our time. Reshape this world in your own image. 

 * Creat an army of countless minions to perform your works.
 * Claim tickets to your favorite events. All will be yours.
 * Expand your empire outside your extension, into the page's own JS.

Historical fact: 2500 years ago Xerces, the God-King of the Persians, built an empire based entirely on Chrome Extensions. Today we will recreate history.
