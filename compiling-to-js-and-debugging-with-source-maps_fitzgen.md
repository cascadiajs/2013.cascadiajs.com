## Abstract

JavaScript is the x86 of the web, and it's important that JavaScript developers
can take advantage of source maps as the popularity of transpiled languages like
CoffeeScript and TypeScript grows. My presentation begins with an overview of
source maps: what they are, and why they're cool. Then, moves into a quick
tutorial overview on generating proper source maps for your language that
compiles to JavaScript. Finally, I demonstrate painlessly debugging the original
source language without dealing with the unnecessary mental overhead of
wrangling with the generated JS code output from your compiler.

I am a firm believer in the open web. I work for Mozilla, hacking on Firefox
Developer Tools. I co-authored the source map specification, and authored the
`source-map` NPM library used by UglifyJS, browserify, CoffeeScriptRedux,
ESCodeGen, and more.
