##Abstract

I actually never really liked writing JavaScript code. It just breaks too often and most times the code looks like a mess. 

It's just a little bit of script, I hear people say. why should I bother? 

But web applications are relying on JavaScript more and more every day. We see JavaScript MVC, MVVM, ... libraries popping up all around us, promising us a better life in JavaScriptland. But that doesn't mean writing JavaScript code suddenly became painless and, even more important, faultless. While for our backend services we have taken the tendency of writing automatic tests that better assure our correctness, we haven't copied that good practice to our front end ... yet. 

In this session I will show you how you can easily test drive your JavaScript code and automate those front end tests. By doing so you will end up with better, cleaner and more structured JavaScript code. It will help you get rid of those runtime bugs once and for all and maybe in the mean time you may even start to love writing JavaScript code.

I work as a software consultant at QFrame, a Cronos Company, specialized in custom .NET development (www.qframe.be). Apart from bringing solutions to our clients, I also coaches people, introduce new technologies to our developers, actively blog, tweet and speak (techdays belgium, mvvmcross event london, community day belgium) about my experiences in software development and try to combine my professional life with relaxing moments of intense shopping. I'm passionate about new technologies, trying to evaluate their proâ€™s and cons and thus keeping a realistic view on the different possibilities. I also tries to keep a broad eye on .NET development, having interests and experience in both web, win, mobile, open source and cloud development.
