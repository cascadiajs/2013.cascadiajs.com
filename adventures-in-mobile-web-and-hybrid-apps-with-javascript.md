##Abstract

This talk will be about how to build mobile web apps/hybrid mobile apps. I used a very small native wrapper that is basically the mobile browser but your app. I will discuss the trials and tribulations of building mobile web apps.

I will also discuss the different tools that I have used over the course of developing mobile apps. This is a differnet approach than the phonegap way of making mobile apps. Also will include tips for real time communication with a node server.
