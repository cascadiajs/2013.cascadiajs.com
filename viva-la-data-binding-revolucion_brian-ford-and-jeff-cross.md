## Abstract
All web applications need to get the right data to the right place at the right time.
From a text input in a DOM to a database on a remote server, developers typically implement several layers of code just to move data back and forth.

What if you could develop Web apps with fewer layers and less code?
And what if the code was more modular and reusable?

Brian and Jeff have discovered a better way through data binding, and will demonstrate its amazingness in AngularJS while interfacing with other parts of their Most Fullest-Stack&trade;*.

*A stack isn't full unless there's a robot in it.

Brian and Jeff are members of the AngularJS team at Google, where they build experimental Angular robots. No interns were harmed in the making of this proposal.
