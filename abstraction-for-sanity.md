## Abstract

A lot of JavaScript code these days suffer from showing all the mechanics of completing a task, and not much of the intention of author or the problem that they're trying to solve. Being confronted with this kind of code can be overwhelming, and trying to maintain it can be quite a nightmare.

In this talk I am going to show examples of code with poor abstraction, and how it is

* difficult to read
* a breeding ground for bugs
* a likely place for the next programmer to make mistakes
* difficult to test

After this horrorshow, I am going to show you some techniques to improve abstraction levels in your code.

After this talk, you will be better equipped to tackle poorly abstracted code, and will leave it better than you found it.

Readers of [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052) should feel right at home with this talk.
