##Abstract

Nowadays, articles on how to structure properly a large JavaScript application are flourishing on the Web. Every three months or so, a new MV* framework is announced. This may be relevant if you're about to write a web app from scratch but how do you deal with a 5-years old application with more than 529,000 js LOC ?  
This is the thrilling challenge we had to face at HootSuite. Over the past years, our dev team grew from 1 to 36 developers. Well structured, testable and maintainable code has become an absolute necessity.

This presentation will walk you through our quest for better code and uncover :

* how we restructured and improved our codebase by small iterations
* how we transitioned from DOM-heavy, tightly-coupled libraries to maintainable modules
* how we provided our devs with tools helping them to write better code
* how we are monitoring code quality
* how we are testing and deploying continuously
* lessons you can take away to refactor your own codebase
