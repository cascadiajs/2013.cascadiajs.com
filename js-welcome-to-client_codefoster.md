##Abstract

It sounds ridiculous to welcome JavaScript to the client, right? Doesn't JavaScript already live and breath the client? Isn't JavaScript to the client what ice tea is to summertime? Well, sort of. I think JavaScript has gotten the shaft - invited to live on the client and then confined to his room in the browser.

Well, not so in Windows 8. When you write a Windows 8 app, one of your choices of language stacks is the web platform. It's an elegant and 100% standards compliant implementation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with an extremely powerful engine, and perhaps most importantly, with a programming language you already know. It enables you, without taking the time to learn new languages, to use your web skills to get an app into the Windows Store. The Store is growing fast and getting in now is like getting in on a good stock.

I'll blaze through the basics and the linger on the more advanced and interesting parts of the web engine in Windows and on the developer tools and techniques for creating apps in this market.

I'll to answer...
- what's the architecture of the web platform in Windows 8?
- what are the differences between my HTML, CSS, and JS running in the browser versus in an app?
- what does it take to get into app development?
- what sort of modern touch and performance support does the JavaScript engine in Windows 8 have?
- what sort of code sharing opportunities are available between Windows 8 apps, other apps, and websites?
