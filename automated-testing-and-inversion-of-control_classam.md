##Abstract

Unit testing: It's probably important or something. 
This is going to be based really heavily on [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSqrmuZQxz0) 
online mini-talk, but I'm going to flesh it out a little bit and extend it into Javascript tools and use-cases. 

* Why is it important? 
 * Making changes to your code: it will break things.
 * Documenting your API by forcing yourself to use it.
 * Improving your API by forcing yourself to use it. 
* How do we get started?
 * Finding a test framework.
 * Finding a test runner.
* Arrange-Act-Assert
* Running Your Tests Regularly (Continuous Integration!)
* Only Test The Thing You're Testing
 * Why integration tests are bad.
 * Why unit tests are good.
 * What is Inversion of Control?
 * Why there aren't any famous IOC frameworks for dynamic languages.
* Mocking out things that are hard to test.
 * Mocking out the DOM.
* The balance between testing and everything else.

I'm a Vancouver software developer, currently working for Simon Fraser University. I am also a bad cartoonist, 
an inconsiderate lover, an air-pugilist, 18 feet tall, and I can shoot laser beams with my eyes (but only when I am
also holding a laser pointer).

I'm an imaginary prop! I work at a web company in Vancouver that specializes in convincing companies to rebuild
their enterprise software with trendy new technology that we are expert consultants in.
