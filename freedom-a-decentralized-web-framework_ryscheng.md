##Abstract

Free and open source web frameworks have played a crucial role 
in catalyzing innovative new applications on the Web. However, 
under the current SaaS model, free software developers who want 
to build on top of these frameworks have to solve the problem of 
logistics, a challenging and expensive situation if you want to 
offer the high availability and scalability users have come to 
expect. In this world if you write a popular app, you may lose 
a little money. If you write a viral app, you may need to sell 
your kidney.

In this talk, I will answer the question: “What does it mean 
to write free web apps?”. In a world of rich multi-user 
global-scale distributed web apps, free software developers 
who want to write browser-facing code need some help. I will 
propose a new model for web app development that challenges the 
way we think about web apps. FreeDOM is a new web framework that 
cleaves the meat of complex web services from the hardware where 
the data is stored and the code is executed. As a research project, 
FreeDOM takes a new stab at making aggregate global service highly 
available, self-scaling, automatically federated, secure, and 
easy-to-use. We are on track to make free software as convenient 
as a typical SaaS web app. By giving more power to the end-user of 
a web app, FreeDOM has profound implications on free software 
distribution as well as privacy in the age of the Web.
