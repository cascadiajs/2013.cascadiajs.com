##Abstract

Emotional safety is the most important predictor of the health of an organization and a community. But more importantly, it has a enduring repurcussions on our lives as individuals. Like, our real livesâ€”the ones we live for our whole lives.

I've worked in intensely unsafe professional environments prior to joining &yet. I'd like to candidly share some of the lessons I've learned from my unique perspective as a female who isn't a software developer but who spends much of her life around them (including co-organizing events like RealtimeConf, RedisConf, and TriConf).

Being "in the developer world but not of it" has given me perspective to identify blind spots within our culture as a company and a community. Traditionally copywriters on a software team are viewed as a supporting role: we help sell what gets made. But what if all contributors to a team were true equals capable of leading and shaping a continuously improving company culture? That's the foundation of emotional safety. 

## Outline: 
- What emotional safety is and why it's important.
- Why it's not something that can be simply tacked on, but must be embedded in culture.
- My struggles with identifying myself as a sexist and the challenges that presents.
- A framework for moving forward to greater emotional safety.]
