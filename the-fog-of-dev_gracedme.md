##Abstract

We use obscure acronyms. We dumb down our explanations. We skip over infrastructure tickets in meetings as "technical stuff, don't worry about it." We are service providers to people who will never understand what we do. We're used to putting up walls around ourselves and our profession. It's what we're used to, and we think it protects us.

But are we caught in a cycle of non-communication with the very users we write for? Or are we programming mostly for ourselves and not for others? How can they ever understand what software can do for them if we never talk to them about it?
