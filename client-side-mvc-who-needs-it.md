## Abstract

In this talk, I'll question the wisdom of what seems to be the first question of frontend web development today: 'what MVC framework are you using?'

Instead of trying to sell you this week's new MVC framework, I am going to show you that you already have plenty of knowledge and the tools to create excellent client side solutions without the crutches of client side MVC frameworks.

My presentation will start with a quick tour of the benefits and drawbacks of current MVC frameworks.
I'll then move on to showing examples of how people are solving the same problems without the headaches of MVC frameworks.
