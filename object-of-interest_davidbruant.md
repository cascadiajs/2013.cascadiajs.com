## Abstract

I gave a talk on [Garbage Collection](www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADiF5UUKDCk) and got asked at the end "Is there a tool
to visualize the object graph of a website at runtime?". I answered negatively at the time. Unsatisfied with what
state-of-the-art browser devtools provide to analyze objects at runtime, I decided to built it (as a Firefox addon for
starters).

In this talk, I'll briefly explain how Garbage Collection and the Mark-and-Sweep algorithm work in modern browsers.
I'll explain what web developers should do to work well with the Garbage Collector and how they can use
[Object of Interest](https://github.com/DavidBruant/OoI) to better understand the JavaScript runtime and to find memory
leaks in their websites.
