## Abstract

Programming today can still feel like a black box, even with all the
new developer tools for debugging code. I think this is because we
don't have the ability to truly customize the debugging experience for
our application. What if we could have a user-land JavaScript debugger
that you could shape to your needs?

It turns out that you can build a real stepping debugger by abusing
`yield` from ES6 generators. By instrumenting every expression with
`yield`, we gain control of the stack and execution while allowing the
native JavaScript VM to still execute everything else. This special
code is run inside our own VM in user-land, and allows you to pause
and step through code.

An example of the instrumented code is
[here](https://github.com/jlongster/steps/blob/gh-pages/test_.js), and
you can step through the code
[here](http://jlongster.github.io/steps/). If we flesh this out, I
think it could be a powerful tool.

I work for Mozilla and help developers write web apps. In my heart I'm
an idealist but I've learned to mix practicality with idealism when
approaching software problems. I have a heavy functional programming
background with Scheme, and used to write DirectX games in high-school
in C++. In fact, I wrote a text-based RPG on my TI-82 calculator
during math class in 7th grade. It didn't take off like I thought it
would.
