##Abstract

JavaScript can be a force for good in terms of ingesting, searching and visualizing 
data in real-time. From JQuery to Backbone to Node.js, JavaScript is up to the 
task of Big Data, which is only getting bigger and realer... even as you read 
this. I'll cover using JavaScript both for processing and managing your data, 
all the way to visualizing it in the browser or from your command line JavaScript 
tools. We'll talk about using Hadoop, Cassandra, Splunk, and other big data 
data-stores as well as other technologies you already know and love like 
Node.js, Backbone and d3.

##Speaker Bio

Itay runs the Developer Platform team at Splunk, where they try and make it
easier for developers to build big-data applications. He didn't use JavaScript
until two years ago, but now he can't seem to escape it!
