##Abstract

November brings college basketball season which culminates with one of the most
exciting events in sports: a 68 team single elimination tournament to declare
a champion. With more than 9.2 *quintillion* possible brackets, how can you write
modular, testable code that will parse, validate, and display each bracket
*and* allow each entry to fit in a single tweet?

I'll detail the web services, node modules, and Backbone code that I've written
for [TweetYourBracket][] to make all this a possibility, going over the stumbles
and aha moments I had along the way. Everyone will be able to get something out
of this, although if you're not already an NCAA basketball fan, you may become one
after you see how much fun you can have writing regex-generating, data-caching,
realtime-updating sportsball code.

Luke makes stuff out of JavaScript at [&yet](http://andyet.com). He lives in
the woodsy mountains of Arizona, but he's from the Internet (the JavaScript
part specifically). He enjoys riding bicycles, eating nachos, and did he
mention JavaScript? Because he likes JavaScript a lot.
