## Abstract

If you thought that building rich, interactive and mobile-friendly visualizations of high volume data with 100,000+ points just using the power of browser-side JavaScript was impossible, this talk will prove you wrong.

Weâ€™ll review every important aspect of achieving peak performance and responsiveness for these types of applications, including search indexes and tree structures, computational geometry and clustering algorithms, real-time data simplification, fast collision detection, advanced use of Web Workers and mixing Canvas with SVG and HTML.

This is a refined and improved version of the talk given at Front-Trends 2013 in Warsaw ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/mourner/high-performance-data-visualizations), [video](https://vimeo.com/68252990)).
