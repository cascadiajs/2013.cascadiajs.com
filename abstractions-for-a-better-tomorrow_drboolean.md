## Abstract

Let's close our eyes, hold hands, & imagine together. Sit here, cross legged, open minded.
We're going to fantasy land.

Welcome friend. Here, all code across languages utilizes a few well known mathematical interfaces.
Here, knowledge gained stays relevant. Here, you can instantly swap 1 module for another,
compose everything, avoid docs, discuss things in common terms, share algorithms, refactor to formulas!

"Bullhonkey", you proclaim as I start to hum a low note quietly, fingers coiled into semi-rings.
"But I hate math and I heard math isn't prog..."
"Shhhhhhh...", I press my finger to your lips. "I did too. Come to my talk & I'll explain everything..."
                                                               
In this talk, we'll look at the FP ecosystem to see how fantasy land is a reality _right now_.
You'll hear why normal folks like you & me get bit by the math bug.
We'll see all of this in understandable JS.
