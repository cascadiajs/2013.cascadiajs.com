##Abstract

This talk is inspired by [Angelina Fabro](https://twitter.com/angelinamagnum)'s  presentation, ['Javascript Masterclass'](http://afabbro.github.io/jsconf2013/) from [JSConf2013](http://2013.jsconf.us/), where she encourages people to 'Teach and/or speak at an event' to improve their 'mastery' as a programmer.

It's easy for developers, seasoned veterans and rookies alike, to feel overwhelmed and intimidated when it comes to social coding and contributing to open source communities.  Many of the most widely publicized contributions and discussions revolve around the nerd celebrities and its challenging for us mere-mortals to figure out how to 'break in'.

Drawing from Angelina's presentation, I will share my thoughts and experiences transitioning from an open source user, to GitHub lurker, and finally to an (albeit small) open source contributer.
