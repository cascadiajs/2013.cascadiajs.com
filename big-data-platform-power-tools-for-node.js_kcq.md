##Abstract

Node.js and JavaScript are great not only for quickly building simple web apps.
This talk will present the tools to build a distributed Big Data platform covering:
* Data queueing with Kafka (and other tools)
* Realtime data process with Storm
* Batch data processing with Hadoop
* Storing data in Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB, MongoDB, and Riak
* Data serialization options (JSON, protobufs, and MsgPack)
* Internal communication with HTTP, hook.io, dnode, and ZeroMQ
* Creating external APIs using the built-in http/https modules, express.js, restify, and hapi

I'm a co-founder at CloudImmunity and a Big Data architect at CrowdStrike.
I use node.js and JavaScript when it makes sense and I use other tools when it doesn't :-)
