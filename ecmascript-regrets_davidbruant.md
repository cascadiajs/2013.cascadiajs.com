## Abstract

JavaScript got implemented and shipped in browsers in a rush; not your textbook way to evaluate a product before handing
it off to your customers. Websites started to be written against the JavaScript that was actually shipped in browsers,
not some ideal language we wish we had. In order to avoid "breaking the web", the Bad Parts of the language not only
weren't removed, but had to be standardized to make sure websites behaved the same way in different browsers.

The [ECMAScript Regrets](https://github.com/DavidBruant/ECMAScript-regrets) project is an attempt at listing all of these
things we wish were removed from the JavaScript language, but can't be because it would break the web.

In this talk, I'll walk through several of these "regrets" and explain what we can do as developers to avoid them
as well as how ECMAScript 5 and 6 help to work around them. From beginners who are fighting against the language to
compile-to-JS language designers who don't want to reiterate mistakes from the past, everyone should be learning something.
