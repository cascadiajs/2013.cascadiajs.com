##Abstract

Prototype-based inheritance is probably one of the most difficult to understand aspects of JavaScript. This is especially true for web developers coming from traditional object-oriented languages with class-based inheritance.

In this presentation, we will look at how Backbone.js, Ember.js and CoffeeScript attempt to bridge the conceptual gap by exposing APIs that simulate class-based inheritance. In particular, we will compare how they implement common operations such as subclassing, declaring instance vs class methods/variables, overriding methods and calling super.

Finally, we will look at how you can solve similar problems today using "pure JavaScript" with ECMAScript 5, then end off with a sneak peek of the proposed ECMAScript 6 class syntax.
