## Abstract

WebRTC is an exciting new set of open standards that promise to bring real time,
plugin-free video, audio and data communication to the web. In this talk I will
give an overview of the core WebRTC APIs, as well as reflect on some of the
lessons I learned while integrating WebRTC into a production application.
Specifically I will cover:

- the steps involved in setting up an RTC Peer Connection
- how ICE, TURN and STUN allow connections to form across complex network topologies
- the server infrastructure necessary to support WebRTC in production
- the availability of the WebRTC APIs now and in the future
