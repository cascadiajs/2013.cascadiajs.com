##Abstract

Back when the web was young, and midi files were still cool, I had a website. And a server, too.
But just as css showed up, I got bored, shut down the server, and turned to desktop applications.
Now I've returned to find that the web has changed. A lot.

While I'm still in the middle of this transition, I'd like to talk about some of the pitfalls I've encountered in server and client javascript, like:
* ways to f*** up callbacks
* biases (it's "just" web development, right?)
* browser hell (what do you mean, it doesn't work in firefox?  (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ )
* responsive design (even images aren't reliable any more)

and more, if there's time.

This talk will **not** cover:
* javascript syntax
* basic html/css

This could also work as an unconference topic - I'd love to hear about other people's experiences.
