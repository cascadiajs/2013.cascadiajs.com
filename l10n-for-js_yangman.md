##Abstract

Localization (L10n) for software is not an easy problem, but one that's been, more or less, sufficiently
solved for the desktop. Unfortunately, the current situation is not so rosy if you're working in JavaScript.

Lets make it better.

This talk discusses lessons learnt in designing and implementing a localization system for
a Javascript thick-client currently in development. Topics include:

* Why Gettext is better than sliced bread
* State of Gettext for JavaScript (spoiler: it's OK, but not great)
* When off-the-shelf doesn't cut it: building the toolchain
* Stuff that bit us: L10n for ExtJS
* Writing translation-friendly strings
* Useful gettext hacks, because JavaScript

Come learn what it took to localize an almost pure JavaScript application without the help of a
L10n aware templating system, and save yourselves some sanity should you choose to travel down the same path.

Yang is a programmer based out of Vancouver who currently spends his
nine-to-five developing web-based software in a small division of a very large engineering
company.

His GitHub page is basically empty because he's too lazy to move his old projects there.
(GitHub didn't exist back then, OK?)
