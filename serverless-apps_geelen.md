##Abstract

While the web development industry has seen a rapid growth of client-side applications, most of these still assume, or depend upon, a traditional application server design. But, with the rise of modern workflow tools supporting static sites, as well as an ever-growing array of hosted or configurationless services, you can now build functional web applications without writing a single line of server-side code.

This talk will go through the ways in which traditional server-side functionality is being moved. A combination of better tooling for client-side code, hosted services for authentication and persistence, and new open-source projects such as [Hoodie](http://hood.ie) all have a part to play.

Of course, security or sensitivity constraints may prevent logic from being wholly client-side, but we'll see how a client-first approach changes the way we think about even these tasks.
