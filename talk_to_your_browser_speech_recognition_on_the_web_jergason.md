## Abstract

Speech recognition has traditionally been the domain of stuffy academia, C code
and terrible fake movie computer interfaces. Thanks to new technologies like
the WebAudioApi and Emscripten, we can get real-time speech recognition in the
browser.

I'll give a quick overview of the basic theory behind speech recognition
(spinkled liberally with puppies so your eyes won't glaze over). Next I'll show
how I got it up and running, followed by some fun demos.

## Speaker Bio

I'm a web application developer at [iTV][] working to make television smarter.
I work in client-side JavaScript, Node.js, Golang, and the magic of children's
laughter.

In my free time I dabble in machine learning, artificial intelligence and
natural language processing. Basically I try to make computers smarter, but not
so smart that they take over and destroy the earth.

I am also experienced in playing tasty blues licks on the guitar.
