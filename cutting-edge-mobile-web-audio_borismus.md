## Abstract

The Web Audio API is nearing ubiquity across browsers, and is even
available in modern mobile browsers! The combination of audio as output,
in addition to all of the interesting inputs (touch, orientation) on
mobile devices and external instruments lets you build really cool
applications. I'll quickly go over the basics of Web Audio and then dive
into a few cutting edge examples:

- Open web mobile musical instruments.
- An introduction to the WebMIDI API and a demo of connected
  instruments.
- Sound as data via ultrasonic networking applications.
- (stretch) Data as sound for auralization.
