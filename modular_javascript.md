##Abstract

In the dark ages, everything was global. Incomprehensible chaos 
reigned. Then the laws of modularity were (re-)discovered and 
applied through the module pattern. Programmers rejoiced. But 
still Javascript could not be tamed. Soon, individual fiefdoms 
of module loaders began sprouting. Javascript became beautiful, 
but at a cost. Programs were now trapped in walled gardens of 
incompatibility. However, we have been promised a way out of 
this morass. ECMAScript 6 introduces 
[Harmony modules](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules). 
Will this be the One Loader To Rule Them All?

This talk will tell the story of modularity in Javascript from its 
inflexible beginnings, to the ephemeral promise Harmony modules. On 
the way, we will visit the pitfalls of monolithic programs, and
experience the pain and power of module loaders.

##Speaker Bio

Andrew Eisenberg works on the [SpringSource](http://www.springsource.org/) 
tools team, creating IDEs and developer tools that programmers love. He has worked on 
[Scripted](https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted), a smart, 
light-weight editor for Javascript. Andrew has a PhD from the 
University of British Columbia where he researched software 
modularity and how it can be better applied to tools and
languages.
