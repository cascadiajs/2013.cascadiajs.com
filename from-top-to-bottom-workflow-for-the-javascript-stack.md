## Abstract

~"From Angular.js, Riak, Testing and Vagrant Dev Environments"

Each developer has to come up with a workflow that works well for them. Sometimes a lot of the workflow is dictated but there is still a lot that's left up to the individual. With many modern tools you have a selection of everything from text editor, to IDE to actual operating system distribution. In this presentation I'm going to walk through some of the tooling to help keep all of these things under control during the course of programming efforts. ...and yes, this will go beyond just the IDE (or text editor, etc)

## Speaker Bio

Yup, that’s me, in a tree, hanging out on a beautiful day in Portland sporting my Amon Amarth hoodie. Don’t know who Amon Amarth is, click the image to find out.

A little about me:

I’m a jovial, proactive, test & code, code & test, get things done well, software architect, engineer, code monkey, coder, and distributed systems advocate. I go by the title of “Coder, Messenger, Recon” as it seems to encompass what I do.

Coder: I write code, sometimes lots of code, sometimes a little code. No language is a limit, only another tool to implement solutions. I ply  polygot language paths including: C#, Java, JavaScript, Erlang lately and Pascal, Basic, Visual Basic, C++, C, COBOL, RPG, CL and others in the past!
Messenger: Every chance I get I work to share knowledge I’ve gained over the years. From workshops to one on one mentoring, pair programming or directed training.
Recon: I love seeing technologies built and technologies come together.
But besides all that techno stuff, I dig some good coffee, great beer, wine, food and a good music show. I cycle, almost everywhere these days, don’t own a car (but I’m a car snob of the serious racing sort auto-x, tuners, drift, rally, etc), I verge on the “transit nerd” and “rail nut” category along with “plane spotter” and “exotic car driver”. I also play guitar – primarily shredding (metal), love to prog with some Jazz and croon along with some blues.
