## Abstract

There are many repetitive tasks we do while coding our front-end
projects: compile Sass sheets or Handlebar templates, run Jasmine tests,
launch a local server... We can save a lot of time by automating these
with [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com), a JavaScript task runner. In this
talk we will see how to setup Grunt to automate some of these common
tasks, with practical examples.
