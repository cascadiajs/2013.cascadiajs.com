##Abstract

Big data analysis techniques have yielded remarkable insights in nearly every industry, from advertising to oil exploration to manufacturing.  What happens when those same techniques are applied to software development, and Node.js in particular?

Well, we’ve done that!  In this talk, we will share the results of analyzing petabytes of performance and debug data across a wide variety of Node.js applications.  This type of analysis can yield a large number of insights, including: 
•	Quicker understanding of the hundreds of thousands or even millions of lines of code from third party modules.
•	Spotting hard-to-find performance bottlenecks.
•	Identifying anomalous behavior in a way that it easier to debug (aka how do you fix those really obnoxious, non-reproducible bugs?) 

We will also do a quick overview of big data analytic techniques for the uninitiated, including our favorite open source big data tools.   We will also share some best practices in writing Node.js apps that we’ve discovered through this analysis.
