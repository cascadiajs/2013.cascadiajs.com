##Abstract

Do you find yourself often copying-and-pasting boilerplate for similar projects? Or do you wish you had boilerplate for those types of projects? Think of Yeoman like smart boilerplate for your projects, using things like Handlebars to cut down repetitve set-ups. As part of the Yeoman suite, use Bower to keep your repositories clean of dependencies and use Grunt to run all your CSS and JS preprocessing, unit tests, linting, and even do LiveReload. In this presentation, we'll go through a beginner's guide to Yeoman, we'll go through on how to go from start to finish on creating your own Yeoman custom generators.
