##Abstract

In November 2012, the folks over at [nodejtisu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) announced a great NodeJS package called [pkgcloud](https://github.com/nodejitsu/pkgcloud).  From their [blog post](http://blog.nodejitsu.com/introducing-pkgcloud): "Pkgcloud is a node.js module that allows interaction with multiple cloud service providers. With the help of this module, you're able to manage a variety of cloud resources from within your application. You can provision compute, storage or database instances with ease."

In this talk, I will discuss our architectural decisions, technical issues, and lessons learned in building out a scalable real-time voice communication platform powered by NodeJS and pkgcloud as well as by IaaS platforms including Rackspace, AWS, and OpenStack.
