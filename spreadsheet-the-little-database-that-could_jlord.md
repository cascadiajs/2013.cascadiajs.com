## Abstract

Google Spreadsheets are a quick, highly-collaborative and low-barrier-to-entry database for small projects and new developers.   Spreadsheet backed projects can empower those breaking into development and those who didn't know getting a hosted, live website could be free and easy. Using GitHub pages, a repository with a spreadsheet backed site on just a gh-pages branch becomes duplicatable with just a fork and commit. With this fork-n-go setup the barrier to entry goes way, way down and brings open source to a whole new crop of non-developers looking to organize communities, visualize or share data.

I've been working on an open source library, sheetsee.js, to make the connection between a spreadsheet and website visualizations easier. Starting with the JSON thisabletop.js returns from your spreadsheet and adding other libraries like d3.js, handlebars.js and mapbox.js - there are tons of possibilities. I'll talk about the different tiers of developing with spreadsheets from server-side with Node.js and client-side with pure JavaScript, the supporting libraries, hosting options and the awesome potential for data sharing and collaboration.
