## Abstract

Microcontroller instruction sets. Electronic circuit theory. Embedded systems design. With great power comes great big scary words — but hardware is really not all that hard!

It can be incredibly easy to get into the Arduino ecosystem with JavaScript and prototype all kinds of fun physical interfaces, sensors and actuators. The trouble comes when you've got your circuit working and want to unhook it from your laptop and send it out into the world — that's where Microstates comes in.

Microstates will help us use mostly JavaScript to build a Web of Things — things that could cost less than $20 apiece! Microstates is a collection of familiar JS *and* not-actually-so-scary hardware blueprints to help you make a lot of little wireless web servers with a few cheap chips.

This session will show how JavaScript has an important place in both the interface and in the backend when pulling the (USB) plug with Microstates, and give a demo of how easy and affordable it can be to implement HTTP status code 418 I'm a teapot.
