##Abstract

Browser interactions aren't just limited to mouse and key events.  Modern browsers support a large range of API's that can be utilized to build interesting applications, but how best to integrate these API's with Angular isn't always obvious. Using a virtual drumset, this session will show how to incorporate multimedia with angular.  We will actually create music, while demonstrating proper use of angular components to interact with the browser in ways beyond simple mouse events.
