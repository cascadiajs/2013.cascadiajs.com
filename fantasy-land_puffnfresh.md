## Abstract

[Fantasy Land](https://github.com/puffnfresh/fantasy-land) is a
project to specify interoperability of common algebraic
structures. Some algebraic structures include functors, monads and
monoids. What do these algebras support, why are they useful and how
can they allow libraries to not repeat ourselves?

This talk will cover the Fantasy Land specification and ecosystem. It
will demonstrate compatible libraries which allow treating
*everything* as a value, including I/O, state, dependency injection,
logging and mutation. It will also show how algebras can improve
performance and how to abuse JavaScript to achieve operator
overloading.

functional programming seriously;
[Brushtail](http://brushtail.brianmckenna.org/), an AST rewriter for
tail-call elimination; and
