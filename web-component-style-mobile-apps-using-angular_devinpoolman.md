##Abstract

Web Components are a collection of emerging W3C standards that aim to simplify web development through well-encapsulated, reusable custom HTML elements.  This holds particular potential for the future of mobile HTML5/hybrid app development, but even with Google's Polymer project it could be several years before we have the mobile browser capabilities that support these technologies in real world deployments.  So how do we get the benefits of Web Components to build mobile apps today?

This talk will explain how we've put together a mix of best-of-breed web technologies, with Angular at its foundation, to deliver on Web Components' promises today.  Leveraging Angular directives, SASS, Bootstrap and a Yeoman/Grunt/Bower-based process, we can quickly build mobile apps using custom HTML elements that encapsulate best practices for mobile apps. During this talk we will walk through the creation of a mobile app using this process - from project scaffolding to real-world performance in a Cordova/PhoneGap environment.  We will share our experiences and learnings from building several enterprise mobile apps, and assembling a collection of reusable custom elements along the way.

I'm the VP of Products at AppGlu working on finding the best ways to simplify enterprise mobile app development and management, from front-end to back-end.  I was previously a founder at Metricly and 8020 Media before that.  I am mostly a product person, but I do wear the front-end or back-end developer hat when needed.
