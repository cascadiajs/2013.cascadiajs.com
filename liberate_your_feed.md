# Liberate your Feed: The State of Open Social

## Description

Social media is dominated by a handful of companies: Twitter, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, etc. In the wake of PRISM, we are confronted with the pitfalls of such consolidation. But we're developers. We're makers. We can do this ourselves.

Promising upstarts have taken on this problem, but there is much more to be done. We'll discuss who's pioneering Open Social, their architectures, and how to roll your own solution using JavaScript up and down the stack.

## Bio

![Me :D](https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1554764061/catlin_bigger.jpg)

In Portland, Oregon born and raised

On the web was where I spent most of my days

Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool

and making crappy websites outside of the school

When a couple of guys, who were up to no good

Started coding node in my neighborhood

I wrote one little app and I got scared

and said, "callbacks are crazy but this has some flair!"
