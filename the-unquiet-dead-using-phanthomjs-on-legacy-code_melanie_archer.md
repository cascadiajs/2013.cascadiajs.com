##Abstract
One of these days you'll have to go through your spooky old codebase. What haunts those dusty corridors? Where are the trap doors? Just what's supposed to be attached to that disembodied limb? 

Quit asking your co-worker, **Did you hear that?!** as you QA your Web application. Get automated JavaScript and CSS tests to run through your house of horrors.

This presentation will answer questions like these:
* I've installed that Phantom/Spooky/Casper-JS stuff. Now what?
* This "headless WebKit" thing gives me the creeps. How can I avoid it?
* Unit-, regression-, or continuous integration tests: which will exorcise the poltergeist haunting my application?

I'm a Web developer comfortably established in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I work with designers and developers on good-looking view layers. I oblige requests to talk at length about silent movies or bicycle commuting.
